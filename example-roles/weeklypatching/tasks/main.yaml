# The ansible way to install patches is to include a file for each os you need
# to install patches on. The file should be named like the output of one of the
# following ansible variables: ansible_os_family ot ansible_distribution.

# Including {{ ansible_os_family }}.yaml will ensure that servers don;t loop
# through the include files. This will accellerate the process. Ansible will
# only include: Debian.yaml or RedHat.yaml
- name: patches -> include os specific playbook
  include_tasks: "{{ ansible_os_family }}.yaml"
